# CLGLJava
CLGLJava is a library to create opencl-rendering windows in Java.
Each Window has two Kernels, one for the UI and one for the actual rendering.

## Engine
The  `Engine` is the main class which manages the scene, window, kernels, etc.

### Getting an Engine Instance
Getting an `Engine` instance is the first step:
```java
//TODO: add code
```
Note that the engine has a generic G, which sould be a class containing core information of your Game or Application. The instance of this class will always be easily accessable through the `Engine` or `Scene`.
